# MangoDB Virtual Pharmacy

_December 17, 2023 by MangoDB Team_

This blog post introduces the MangoDB Virtual Pharmacy, a fully optimized and digitalized platform providing a user-friendly interface for patients, pharmacists, and administrators.

## Vision

Our vision was to create a platform that is user-friendly and efficient while maintaining high levels of accessibility. We achieved high optimization by grouping similar features together to enhance user experience and efficiency.

## Features

### Patients

Patients can view and filter medications, order medications to their saved or new address, and chat with a pharmacist.

### Pharmacists

Pharmacists can update the prices and quantities of medicines, and start a chat with a doctor.

We will discuss these features in further detail in upcoming posts. Stay tuned!
